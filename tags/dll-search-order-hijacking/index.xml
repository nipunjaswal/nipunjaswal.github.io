      <description>If you think i am lazy with my posts, Hell Yeah! you are absolutely correct. Sometimes I feel 24-hours in a day are just not enough. I have ton of things to care about in life, things such as my family and my work, my friends who are like my family. I delivered my last session on 10th (if i remember correctly) in my very own Alma materÂ i.e. Lovely professional university and it was a great experience as always.</description>

      <description>Hey Folks, let us today discuss about C|EH certification and discuss why it&amp;rsquo;s always an upper hand to get one, rather than a local company based certification.  C|EH is an IT security certification by EC-COUNCIL and has been more than a standard rather than a certification. what it means is that C|EH is almost mandatory in all the IT security jobs out there.
I have seen so many people quarrel on the subject that &amp;ldquo;C|EH course doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide knowledge&amp;rdquo;.</description>

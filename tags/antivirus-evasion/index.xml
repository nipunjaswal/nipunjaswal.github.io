      <description>If you think i am lazy with my posts, Hell Yeah! you are absolutely correct. Sometimes I feel 24-hours in a day are just not enough. I have ton of things to care about in life, things such as my family and my work, my friends who are like my family. I delivered my last session on 10th (if i remember correctly) in my very own Alma materÂ i.e. Lovely professional university and it was a great experience as always.</description>

      <description>Long time huh? I just updated my website and i am hoping that you will like the new look and feel. I have been working recently on tons of AV solutions, trying to get the insight of how can one evade detection without using any crypters or obfuscation. Ahh, i know the topic is a bit touchy or you may think why am i discussing AV bypasses at the first place.</description>

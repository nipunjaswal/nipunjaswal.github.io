      <description>Holla Guys, It&amp;rsquo;s been a while I have been on my very own domain :P Anyways, today I would like to show you guys few things I have done in the past few years. I have been playing around with a lot of Arduino chips and ended up creating a clone of the USB Rubber Ducky using the keyboard libraries.  By using cheap Arduino chips I was not only able to run commands on my computer system but was able to bypass Android 4-Digit lock in less than 2 hours.</description>
